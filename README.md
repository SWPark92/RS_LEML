# RS_LEML

The implementation code for 'Riemannian  Submanifold  Framework  for  Log-Euclidean Metric Learning on Symmetric Positive Definite Manifolds'. 

The code is based on the modified version of the original code from the paper 'M.Harandi, M. Salzmann and R. Hartley, "From manifold to manifold: geometry-aware dimensionality reduction for SPD matrices'.
